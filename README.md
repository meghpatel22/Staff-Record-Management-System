# 🧾 Staff Record Management System in C++

This project is a **console-based staff record management system** built using **C++**. It displays a predefined list of staff details such as name, age, branch, gender, and email in a clean tabular format.

It demonstrates the use of:
- Standard Input/Output in C++
- Screen clearing with `system("cls")`
- Basic formatting and structured display of records

> ✅ This repository includes a precompiled Windows `.exe` file (`staff_record.exe`) so you can directly run the application without compiling the code.

## 🎯 Features

- Displays staff records in a structured format
- Uses C++ Standard Library headers (`<iostream>`, `<string>`)
- Clears screen before showing output (Windows-compatible)
- Beginner-friendly and simple to understand
- Extendable for features like add/edit/delete/search
